The overall goal of this project is to learn about the informatics approach to emerging infectious diseases in population and public health. Then to present some of the information that was learned. 

I worked with Daniel Akama Nyamweya throughout this research. We found eight total peer-reviewed articles, journals, or books pertaining to our topic. We read through and try to extrapolate the information we learned from these papers into a presentable form.

Challenges:
There were a few challenges that we encountered throughout the process of this project:
  - Finding credible, up to date sources pertaining to the topic.
  - Reading through the entirety of certain papers.
  - Being able to condense the information down into a 7 minute presentation.

Outcome:
We successfully learned about the informatics approach when dealing with emerging infectious diseases. Topics such as the introduction to emerging infectious diseases, the informatics involved with public health surveillance, impact on the public health, real-world application, challenges, and future improvements can be seen in the two attached files (slides and video presentation) for this project.

Project Files:
Two files are attached in the repository for this project:
- Informatics Approach to Emerging Infectious Diseases.pdf: This is the slideshow of the knowledge that was gained.
- SAT5424video.mp4: This is the mp4 video file that I collaborated with Daniel Akama Nyamweya to record.
